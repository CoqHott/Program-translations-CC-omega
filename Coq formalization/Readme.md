## Description
This directory contains the formalization of the correctness of several translation of CCÏ‰ into itself.

This formalization relies uppon a previous formalization of PTS by Vincent Siles and Hugo Herbelin which is available here:
* http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~vsiles/coq/PTSATR.html
* or http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/coq/pylons/coq/pylons/contribs/view/PTSATR/trunk


## Compilation
To compile the project, generate the Makefile using:

   `coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile`

And then run:

    make

(compile with Coq 8.5).


## Description of files
Three of the translations have been formalized:

* The intensional functions translation

Source system: PTS.v

Target system: PTS_SigmaBool.v

Translation: tsl_functions.v


* The intensional types translation

Source system: PTS_Prop.v

Target system: PTS_SigmaBoolProp.v

Translation: tsl_types.v

Remark: we use an intermediate typing predicate defined in PTS_Prop_weakend.v

Remark: thining has been admitted, but only to show consistency preservation, which is quite direct.


* The intensional streams translation

Source system: PTS_Stream.v

Target system: PTS_SigmaBoolStream.v

Translation: tsl_Streams.v

Remark: Some basic axioms of De Bruijn indices manipulation and thining are still admitted in this translation
	as their formalization is tedious and, we think, not so interesting.
	You can check them using the command "Print Assumptions" at the end of the file tsl_Streams.v.
